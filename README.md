Spring Boot RESTful API Development
Overview
Welcome to the repository showcasing my experience in Spring Boot RESTful API development. This repository serves as a demonstration of my expertise in building robust, scalable, and maintainable APIs using the Spring Boot framework.

Features
Spring Boot: Utilizing the power of Spring Boot for rapid application development and streamlined configuration.
RESTful Architecture: Designing APIs following RESTful principles for clear, predictable, and standardized communication.
Database Integration: Seamless integration with various databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc., for persistent data storage.
Security: Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure APIs using Spring Security and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Swagger Documentation: Generating comprehensive API documentation using Swagger UI for improved collaboration and understanding.
Testing: Ensuring reliability and stability through unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing with tools like JUnit and Mockito.
Logging and Monitoring: Implementing logging with SLF4J and monitoring API performance and health with Spring Boot Actuator.
